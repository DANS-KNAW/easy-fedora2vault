An AIP is a DANS-V0 bag , a SIP is a directory with a bag and a deposit.properties file. ARGUMENTS \u00b6 -d, --datasetId <arg> A single easy-dataset-id to be transformed. Use either this or the input-file argument -e, --europeana If provided, only the largest pdf/image will selected as payload. -i, --input-file <arg> File containing a newline-separated list of easy-dataset-ids to be transformed. Use either this or the dataset-id argument -l, --log-file <arg> The name of the logfile in csv format. If not provided a file easy-fedora-to-bag-<timestamp>.csv will be created in the home-dir of the user. (default = /home/vagrant/easy-fedora-to-bag-2020-02-02T20:20:02.000Z.csv) -o, --output-dir <arg> Empty directory that will be created if it doesn't exist. Successful bags (or packages) will be moved to this directory. -f, --output-format <arg> Output format: AIP, SIP. 'SIP' is only implemented for simple, it creates the bags one directory level deeper. easy-bag-to-deposit completes these sips with deposit.properties -s, --strict If provided, the transformation will check whether the datasets adhere to the requirements of the chosen transformation. -h, --help Show help message -v, --version Show version of this program trailing arguments: transformation (required) The type of transformation used: simple, thematische-collectie, original-versioned, fedora-versioned. EXAMPLES \u00b6 $ easy-fedora-to-bag -d easy-dataset:1001 -o ~/stagedAIPs -f AIP simple creates a directory in '~/stagedAIPs'. This directory is an AIP bag, it has the UUID as the directory name, and contains all relevant information from 'easy-dataset:1001' using the 'simple' transformation. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -d easy-dataset:1001 -s -o ~/stagedAIPs -f AIP simple easy-dataset:1001 is transformed according to the simple transformation, but only if it fulfils the requirements. The AIP bag is generated in directory '~/stagedAIPs'. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -s -i dataset_ids.txt -o ./stagedAIPs -l ./outputLogfile.csv -f AIP simple Creates a bag in './stagedAIPs' for each dataset in 'dataset_ids.txt' using the 'simple' transformation. If a dataset does not adhere to the 'simple' requirements, or is not deposited by 'testDepositor', it will not be considered and an explanation will be recorded in 'outputLogfile.csv'. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -i dataset_ids.txt -f SIP -o ./stagedSIPs -e simple Creates bags for all dataset-ids in dataset_ids.txt using the 'simple' transformation. The payload consists of only one file, the largest PDF or image in the datasets. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -i dataset_ids.txt fedora-versioned Dry run, each line in the log-file will contain one or more dataset IDs. The first dataset on a line is the first version for the rest of the datasets on the same line. $ easy-fedora-to-bag -i dataset_ids.txt -f SIP -o ./stagedSIPs fedora-versioned Takes the output of a dry run to create simple bags. RESULTING FILES \u00b6 A <log-file> is generated in csv format with the following headers: easy-dataset-id input easy-dataset-id UUID UUID created for the resulting package of the specified output format doi doi as it appears in the EMD depositor EASY-User-Account of the depositor of the dataset transformation transformation used comments if the dataset does not conform to the transformation-requirements, it is chronicled here For every dataset in the input a bag-directory is created (or more in case of a versioned transformation): * in case of AIP: <output-dir>/<bag-UUID> * in case of SIP: <output-dir>/<package-UUID>/<bag-UUID> In case of problems (possibly incomplete) bags or packages may be left in the directory defined with staging.dir in the application properties . The bag-directories contain the transformed metadata and data in a DANS-Bagit-Profile. The bag-info.txt file will contain at least: EASY-User-Account: ... Created: ... Payload-Oxum: ... Bagging-Date: ... Bag-Size: ... TRANSFORMATIONS \u00b6 SIMPLE \u00b6 A simple transformation transforms the dataset, with no consideration of other datasets, 'thematische collecties' or external storage. With the option --strict the transformation will check that the input dataset conforms to the following requirements. The dataset has a DANS-DOI is PUBLISHED is REQUEST_PERMISSION or OPEN_ACCESS has no Jumpoff page (i.e. there is no dans-jumpoff object in Fedora with a isJumpoffPageFor relation to this dataset) has no replaces or isVersionOf relation that references a DANS-DOI, DANS-URN or easy-dataset-id is no thematische collectie (i.e. the title does not contain thematische collectie ) is not in the vault already (i.e. check in easy-bag-index ) original-versioned \u00b6 An original-versioned transformation transforms the dataset into two bags, if there exists an original folder and at least 1 file outside this folder (*) . The first bag will contain the content of the original folder. The second bag will contain the accessible files from the original folder, and all remaining files. Output for a dataset that meets the conditions to produce two bags: <output-dir>/<package-1-UUID>/<bag-1-UUID>/bag-info-txt <output-dir>/<package-2-UUID>/<bag-2-UUID>/bag-info-txt The bag-info.txt of the second bag will have additional content to refer to the first bag, an example: Is-Version-Of: urn:uuid:<package-1-UUID> Base-DOI: 10.17026/test-Iiib-z9p-4ywa Base-URN: urn:nbn:nl:ui:13-00-1haq fedora-versioned \u00b6 A fedora-versioned transformation takes several dataset-ids that are meant to be versions of each other, and creates a bag-sequence in the given order. Each line of the input-file should contain a list of dataset-ids, in the correct order, first version first. Omitting the option output-dir implies a dry run. In that case the CSV file will have one bag-sequence per line. A sequence may contain datasets not in the input if referenced by datasets in the input. Datasets not in the input that reference a sequence but are not referenced by a sequence won't appear. Except for the first dataset of each input line, bag-info.txt will have additional content (like for original-versioned) to refer to the package of the first dataset on the same input line. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently this project is build only as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-fedora-to-bag and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-fedora-to-bag . BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-fedora-to-bag.git cd easy-fedora-to-bag mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#easy-fedora-to-bag","text":"Retrieves a dataset from Fedora and transforms it to an AIP bag conforming to DANS-BagIt-Profile v0","title":"easy-fedora-to-bag"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"easy-fedora-to-bag {-d <dataset-id> | -i <dataset-ids-file>} -o <output-dir> [-s] [-l <log-file>] [-e] -f { AIP | SIP } <transformation>","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"Tool for exporting datasets from Fedora and constructing Archival/Submission Information Packages.
